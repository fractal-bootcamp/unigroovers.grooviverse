Generate a universe with following properties: name, age, and size.
The name will start with a random letter. The name need not be easy to pronounce. You are strongly encouraged to use non-English characters, but be sure the name is readable to English speakers. The name should not contain any substrings (length 4 or greater) that are valid English words.
The age of the universe should be a totally random number between 1 and 10,000 with up to 2 decimal places on the scale of billions of billions of years. Specifically some random number of "billions of billions" - do not use any other unit.
The size of the universe should be a totally random number between 100,000 and 10,000,000. It may have up to 2 decimal places, and must have the unit "parsecs".
Please also provide a description of the universe. Be sure to include some information on the history of the universe, suggesting at a larger storyline. Do not make it sound like a realistic documentary.
