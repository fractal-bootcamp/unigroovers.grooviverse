Generate a ${type} with following properties: name, age, and size.
The name will start with a random letter. The name need not be easy to pronounce. You are strongly encouraged to use non-English characters, but be sure the name is readable to English speakers. The name should not contain any substrings (length 4 or greater) that are valid English words.
The age of the ${type} should be a totally random number between ${age_min} and ${age_max} with up to 2 decimal places. Specifically some random number of "${age_unit}" - do not use any other unit.
The size of the ${type} should be a totally random number between ${size_min} and ${size_max}. It may have up to 2 decimal places, and must have the unit "${size_unit}".
Please also provide a description of the ${type}. Be sure to include some information on the history of the ${type}, suggesting at a larger storyline. Do not make it sound like a realistic documentary.

For context, this ${type} belongs to a larger ${parent.type}. Here's some information about that ${parent.type}:
